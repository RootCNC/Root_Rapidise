# Root CNC - Gcode Rapidise tool for Fusion360 CAM generated Gcode

Root_Rapdise is a tool that aims to add rapid movements back into the Gcode generated by Fusion360 CAM, which has been limited by the for persional user version of Fusion.

The tool will add a user defined feederate to movements above a given threshold.

This tool is a work around to the current notification for rapid movements in Fusion360

    ;When using Fusion 360 for Personal Use, the feedrate of
    ;rapid moves is reduced to match the feedrate of cutting
    ;moves, which can increase machining time. Unrestricted rapid
    ;moves are available with a Fusion 360 Subscription.
